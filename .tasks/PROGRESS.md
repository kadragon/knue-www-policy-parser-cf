# Progress Log - Policy Link Collection Worker

**Task ID**: `init-policy-parser`  
**Started**: 2025-10-19T11:30:00+09:00  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Timeline (KST)

### [2025-10-19 11:30] Scope Confirmation
- Reviewed requirements for daily policy sync, KV registry ownership, and Markdown export expectations.
- Captured source HTML fixture and verified 96 unique `fileNo` entries.

### [2025-10-19 11:45] Fetcher & Parser Implementation
- Implemented `fetchPolicyPage` with AbortController, retry logic, and exponential backoff.
- Added parser utilities to deduplicate by `fileNo` and enrich titles using localized regex.
- Wrote unit tests covering happy path, duplicates, and missing titles.

### [2025-10-19 12:10] KV Synchronization Layer
- Built `KVManager` (batch CRUD, queue helpers, metadata persistence).  
- Implemented `PolicySynchronizer` add/update/delete detection, validation filters, and queue enqueueing.
- Added comprehensive Vitest coverage (duplicate titles, empty payloads, mixed operations).

### [2025-10-19 12:40] Preview & Export Layer
- Implemented preview API client with bearer auth, timeout, and retry w/backoff.  
- Created Markdown formatter with YAML front matter, localized timestamps, and optional preview sections.  
- Added `writePoliciestoR2ByTitle` (per-policy Markdown) and verified content type + logging.  
- Maintained legacy JSON writer with idempotent skip logic.

### [2025-10-19 13:10] Integration Assembly
- Composed scheduled workflow combining fetch → parse → enrich → KV sync → R2 exports → summary logging.  
- Ensured secrets are never logged; preview failures downgrade to warnings.  
- Added integration test verifying cron guard, KV updates, Markdown exports, JSON skip, and preview enrichment.

### [2025-10-19 13:40] Tooling & Documentation
- Updated `wrangler.jsonc` cron to `0 16 * * *`, added KV + preview variables, and enumerated secrets.  
- Ran `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (all green).  
- Refreshed `.spec/` and `.tasks/` suites to align with final behavior.

## Metrics
- **Tests**: Vitest suite covering parser, preview, KV, R2, integration (all passing).  
- **Runtime**: Integration test indicates <1s simulated execution; production target <10s.  
- **Outputs**: Per-policy Markdown (UTF-8, text/markdown) + JSON snapshot (application/json).

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Preview API downtime | Markdown export continues; log warning, no hard failure |
| KV bloat from legacy titles | Delete-on-missing ensures removal; queue cleanup performed |
| HTML structure drift | Fixture monitoring + parser regex adjustments documented in `.tasks/PLAN.md` |

## Next Actions
- Deploy via `npm run deploy` once secrets verified in production environment.  
- Monitor first production cron cycle (expected 2025-10-20T01:00:00+09:00) in Cloudflare logs.  
- Schedule follow-up to evaluate PDF ingestion requirements.
